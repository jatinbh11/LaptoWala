               <p> Mainstream laptops are very general use laptops intended for the most commonly used applications such as Microsoft Office, E-mails, and web browsing. More expensive models come with more advanced features such as dedicated graphics, more powerful processors, and high resolution displays, and are capable of using more intensive applications, but are unnecessary for the majority of users.</p>
